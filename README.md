# Adult Income Prediction â€” ML Assignment

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This project is part of my **Intermediate Machine Learning** course, and it focuses on building a classification model using the **Adult Income dataset**. 
The goal is to predict whether a person earns more than $50K a year based on features like age, education, occupation, and hours worked per week.

Iâ€™m using this project to apply what Iâ€™ve learned so farâ€”especially around data cleaning, preprocessing, and trying out different models to see what performs best.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains information collected from the U.S. Census. It has around 32,000 entries and 15 columns, including:

- Demographic data (age, sex, race)
- Education and work info
- Target column: `income` (`<=50K` or `>50K`)


## Current Status

This is still a **work in progress**, so Iâ€™ll be updating the notebook and code as I go. Right now Iâ€™m focused on improving the modelâ€™s performance and getting more comfortable with model evaluation techniques.

If you have suggestions or want to share tipsâ€”feel free to reach out!
